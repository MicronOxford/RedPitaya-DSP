ActionTable Runner
==================

The GNU build system is used for the build of the ActionTable Runner.
This means that a developer needs to have automake, autoconf, and GNU
make installed on the system.  The end user needs only GNU make.

To build:

  1. Run `bootstrap.sh` to generate a configure script.

  2. Run the `configure` from wherever you want to do the build.  It is
    recommended to do this some place other than the source tree.

  3. Run `make` to have everything build.

See the `INSTALL` file for more detailed instructions.  This file is
only included on releases.  If you are installing from git checkout,
the file will be created as part of `bootstrap.sh`.


Cross compiling
---------------

For cross compiling, use the `--build' and `--host' options of the
configure script.  Like so:

  ## Build in x86_64 for an armv7l (RedPitaya)
  configure --build=x86_64-linux-gnu --host=arm-linux-gnueabihf

This requires a compiler for the host architecture, as well as the
libraries for cross-compilation.  On Debian 9, these would be the
packages gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf and libc6-armhf-cross.


Start the server
----------------

Run server from a prompt on the Red Pitaya.

the Pyro URI will be displayed with a random port for testing.

If connecting with cockpit fails with a timeout error, this is probably because the versions of Pyro on the cockpit machine and the Red Pitaya do not match.
